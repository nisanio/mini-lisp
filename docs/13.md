# Chapter 13 — Testing and Examples

## 13.1 Overview

Testing is integral to Mini Lisp’s development. The repository includes a `tests/` directory for unit-style validation and an `examples/` directory demonstrating idiomatic usage.

## 13.2 Test Suite (`tests/`)

### 13.2.1 Structure

* Files are numbered (`01_basic.lisp`, `02_lambda.lisp`, … `05_errors.lisp`).
* Each test script exercises a specific subsystem.

### 13.2.2 Coverage

* **Basic evaluation**: arithmetic, quoting, lists.
* **Functions**: lambdas, closures, application.
* **Macros**: validation of `and`, `unless`, expansion hygiene.
* **Errors**: invalid macros, unbound symbols, non-callable applications.

### 13.2.3 Error Tests

* `05_errors.lisp` deliberately triggers errors.
* Confirms that runtime prints messages and continues without crashing.

### 13.2.4 Execution

Tests are run by invoking:

```bash
./minilisp stdlib.lisp tests/<file>.lisp
```

Exit code is always `0` unless modified for strict mode.

## 13.3 Examples (`examples/`)

### 13.3.1 Purpose

* Illustrate usage beyond unit tests.
* Serve as reference programs for end-users.

### 13.3.2 Content

* **Algorithms**: Fibonacci, Kadane’s algorithm, parenthesis matcher, anagram solver.
* **List utilities**: sorting, mapping, filtering.
* **Macro use cases**: conditionals, boolean operators.

### 13.3.3 Interaction with `stdlib.lisp`

* Examples typically load `stdlib.lisp` for helper functions.
* With macro support, many examples can be simplified (e.g., replacing `when-fn` with `when`).

## 13.4 Continuous Testing (Future)

* Integrate into CI (see Chapter 12).
* Automatically run all scripts in `tests/` and selected programs in `examples/`.
