# Chapter 17 â€” Roadmap and Future Work

## 17.1 Overview

Mini Lisp has achieved a stable baseline with evaluation, hygienic macros, and a usable standard library. Future work can improve functionality, performance, and developer experience.

## 17.2 Planned Improvements

* **Macro System**:

  * Support for procedural macros in addition to declarative `syntax-rules`.
  * Nested ellipses for advanced pattern matching.
* **Evaluator**:

  * Implement tail-call optimization (TCO) for recursion-heavy programs.
  * Optional strict error handling with nonzero exit codes.
* **Environment Model**:

  * Optimized symbol lookup (flattened frames, dictionary caching).
  * Support for modules/namespaces.
* **Memory Management**:

  * Introduce garbage collection (mark-and-sweep or reference counting).
  * Region-based allocation for REPL sessions.
* **Performance**:

  * Bytecode compilation or JIT execution layer.
  * Memoization of macro expansions.

## 17.3 Technical Debt

* Current error handling always returns `nil`, which may mask failures.
* No GC leads to unbounded memory growth in long sessions.
* Lack of tail-call optimization restricts recursion depth.
* Hygiene model relies on scope marking only, not full alpha-renaming.

## 17.4 Tooling

* **Testing**: Add automated runner for `tests/` directory.
* **CI**: Integrate GitHub Actions or similar to build and test on each commit.
* **Documentation**: Continue expanding Markdown book (this document) as canonical reference.

## 17.5 Long-Term Goals

* **Educational Use**: Maintain Mini Lisp as a reference for teaching Lisp internals.
* **Practical Extensions**: Gradually evolve into a small scripting language for automation.
* **Community Contributions**: Encourage forks that experiment with GC, bytecode, or advanced macros.
